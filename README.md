- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @J-L-Cant
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data analytics, statistical models, AB testing of digital products, and virtual economies.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently attempting to translate my AWS Quicksight knowledge over to other data visualisation tools. Power BI is my current attempt; so far the only differences are some UI choices.
